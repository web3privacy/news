### Saucy Quote ðŸ¥«

"what if the vaunted future hoped for by the original cypherpunks is only arriving now

what if it is not infrastructure, or apps, or memecoins, or any of these things, but rather simply the right version of the thing that was meant to be built

private internet money."

(yes, penumbra again, but their tweets are just so good!)

Until next week - let's make privacy sexy.
