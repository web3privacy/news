hi and welcome back, 

after the [Ethereum Cypherpunk Congress](https://lu.ma/w3pn-meetup-devcon7) shebang we are continuing with the news, as usual

but first, for the ones that missed it - we just celebrated our **2nd Birthday**! 


we accepted our birthday wishes on X and we were happy to gather up the community feedback [here](https://mirror.xyz/0x0f1F3DAf416B74DB3DE55Eb4D7513a80F4841073/VYszh2TDpNpyEmSNUCJtGxtJj0-CDzEqr0RKdArUxHw)


but arguably, the best birthday gift - the overwhelming support of our community, volunteers and partners.

thank you for showing us so much love, also you - the person reading this :)


so, cheesy moment over. 
**what has been happening in the world of privacy?**
