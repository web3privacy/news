What's crackin' @everyone 

Weâ€™ve got *a lot* of personal updates to spill this week!

Fresh off an incredible [event](https://web3privacy.info/event/m24rom/) in Rome at an underground venue, where we hosted talks from [Denis Roio](https://x.com/jaromil), [Arturo Filasto](https://twitter.com/hellais), Luca Lezzerini, Andrea Togni, [Emanuele Russo](https://twitter.com/emanuele82) and Marco Castignoli (pss, videos dropping soon). 
We capped off the evening in true Web3Privacy community style - deep talks, happy vibes and and beer flowing till the wee hours.

On top of that, weâ€™re excited to announce that we sponsored a bounty at [ETHRome](https://www.ethrome.org/). We will feature Bounty winners next Monday.

And, in case you missed it, we also launched the [Privacy Builder Pack](https://absorbing-diagram-66b.notion.site/Privacy-Builder-Pack-2cae5f1e195c4970b4eb41a14d3f4bde), lovingly crafted by [Jensei](https://x.com/jensei_) to give builders in the space the tools they need to get started.

And now for the nitty gritty...

### Saucy Advice ðŸ¥«
Pick a date to be offline â†’ Let friends and family know youâ€™ll be offline, or better yet, invite them to join you!
For all of us smitten with privacy, going offline is the sweetest act of devotion. 
Alternatively, get one of those [bad boys](https://www.ebay.it/itm/325892632180?_skw=nokia+nokia+3310&itmmeta=01J9GN5N0S75PH5RYQNW1G03FJ&hash=item4be0b6ee74:g:aH8AAOSw4JpjzR8k&itmprp=enc%3AAQAJAAAA8Mxmj%2BiGvOveHXEBClPb29ixfJhA%2B5kKWQm%2BiZ8h0gKxvvyToiqiO0hZwA3f5%2BvPKPI8W1L5cp%2BLHuSX%2Bh4VRRh0RlJx10frUwyvwYX7h1yRGiE6AHGVY7BBET2gAaHNT5WZ6YcCm%2BhGMg2OpPCZJmb7czQlR8tL4Qem2OZjItarNd5f4TwYZ1%2Byp0u%2FcLcpXNAHhiFPQv77CFfTBhEugyS13MHXzyENP1yLlwdNs%2B5hBa1Fws5icRT9ng98TiT1wQXo2OEAWfoXP559CrWOq8HuuwSJ7MQ%2BYFAdJSZUGMYTiHIhDtSscXTRbShJ%2BoQt%2Bw%3D%3D%7Ctkp%3ABFBMwNCWlcxk).
