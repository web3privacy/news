What's crackin' @everyone 

We’ve got *a lot* of personal updates to spill this week!

Fresh off an incredible [event](https://web3privacy.info/event/m24rom/) in Rome at an underground venue, where we hosted talks from [Denis Roio](https://x.com/jaromil), [Arturo Filasto](https://twitter.com/hellais), Luca Lezzerini, Andrea Togni, [Emanuele Russo](https://twitter.com/emanuele82) and Marco Castignoli (pss, videos dropping soon). 
We capped off the evening in true Web3Privacy community style - deep talks, happy vibes and and beer flowing till the wee hours.

On top of that, we’re excited to announce that we sponsored a bounty at [ETHRome](https://www.ethrome.org/). We will feature Bounty winners next Monday.

And, in case you missed it, we also launched the [Privacy Builder Pack](https://absorbing-diagram-66b.notion.site/Privacy-Builder-Pack-2cae5f1e195c4970b4eb41a14d3f4bde), lovingly crafted by [Jensei](https://x.com/jensei_) to give builders in the space the tools they need to get started.

And now for the nitty gritty...

### Saucy Advice 🥫
Pick a date to be offline → Let friends and family know you’ll be offline, or better yet, invite them to join you!
For all of us smitten with privacy, going offline is the sweetest act of devotion. 
Alternatively, get one of those [bad boys](https://www.ebay.it/itm/325892632180?_skw=nokia+nokia+3310&itmmeta=01J9GN5N0S75PH5RYQNW1G03FJ&hash=item4be0b6ee74:g:aH8AAOSw4JpjzR8k&itmprp=enc%3AAQAJAAAA8Mxmj%2BiGvOveHXEBClPb29ixfJhA%2B5kKWQm%2BiZ8h0gKxvvyToiqiO0hZwA3f5%2BvPKPI8W1L5cp%2BLHuSX%2Bh4VRRh0RlJx10frUwyvwYX7h1yRGiE6AHGVY7BBET2gAaHNT5WZ6YcCm%2BhGMg2OpPCZJmb7czQlR8tL4Qem2OZjItarNd5f4TwYZ1%2Byp0u%2FcLcpXNAHhiFPQv77CFfTBhEugyS13MHXzyENP1yLlwdNs%2B5hBa1Fws5icRT9ng98TiT1wQXo2OEAWfoXP559CrWOq8HuuwSJ7MQ%2BYFAdJSZUGMYTiHIhDtSscXTRbShJ%2BoQt%2Bw%3D%3D%7Ctkp%3ABFBMwNCWlcxk).
