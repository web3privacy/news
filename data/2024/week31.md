### Explorer 

In a tangled world wide web of information, a jungle where every option seems to have a hidden gotcha, we have all have become sceptical of the motives behind each and every source of information As the debate around technology's impact on society intensifies, privacy has taken centre stage. Many of us, who once treated privacy as an afterthought, are now asking: "Where do I even start?"

That's where you—the techno-optimist—comes into the picture.

To empower peers and future users according to their privacy, risk, and transparency needs, we invite you to list your project on the [Web3Privacy Explorer](https://explorer.web3privacy.info/). It doesn’t matter if it’s your own project, or your favourite tool.

cont. reading our Mirror post about the Explorer [here](https://mirror.xyz/0x0f1F3DAf416B74DB3DE55Eb4D7513a80F4841073/-Vu8UYstwv1Br4XVTfoUYHFu24S77aezdSY4IM1FUV4)


This weeks spotlight is on [Waku](https://explorer.web3privacy.info/project/waku)!

<img width="1175" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-21 at 2 37 24 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de88ce9a-1a83-441a-84e4-68a9e35e9b7e">

With it's shining 83% score, I asked one of their contributors [Václav Pavlín](https://x.com/vpavlin) some questions: 

How is Waku different from other protocols?
*Waku does not compromise on privacy, censorship resistance and permissionless nature. It's aim is to enable any project to onboard quickly on an extensive network of p2p nodes and focus on your protocol, rather than bootstrapping and building a network from scratch.*

What’s the next hot feature Waku is working on?
*There is a lot going on - end-to-end reliability protocol is huge, incentivization, RLN on mainnet with variable rate limits per user, Store sync to make sure all store nodes return same history...*

How would you sum up Waku team culture in one word?
*Open.*

That's it on the Explorer and don't forget to add your favorite projects [here](https://explorer.web3privacy.info/project/create)!
