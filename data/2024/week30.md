hello and welcome!

this week we would like to give a spotlight to projects that won our bounty at [ETHRome](https://x.com/ETHRome). 

> [SafeBlow](https://taikai.network/ethrome/hackathons/ethrome-24/projects/cm1v7swd803l4148w0xs03day/idea) 🛟 helps whistleblowers send their whistles securely, privately, and quickly, by  enabling the verification of reports without storing individual identities, utilizing a proof-of-personhood solution through TLS Verification, and implementing a client hash identifier to separate identifying data from report content.

> [Fischietto](https://taikai.network/ethrome/hackathons/ethrome-24/projects/cm1wpmq58000qh12dw418ownw/idea) 🤫 is a privacy-centric whistleblowing platform using Aztec ZKPs and Fhenix encrypted data storage to ensure anonymous, secure, and verifiable reporting of workplace issues.

> [Vox](https://taikai.network/ethrome/hackathons/ethrome-24/projects/cm1vw2ahy03o8148whytxec1k/idea) 🗯️ is a private, secure and sybil-resistant petition platform. Citizens can fight the status-quo without fear of repercussion. Each signature is sure to come from a unique citizen.

> [SHIELD SPACE](https://taikai.network/ethrome/hackathons/ethrome-24/projects/cm1wr1y8t0021h12dolec3083/idea) 🛡️ is a secure platform for sensitive communities hosting private, confidential events, ensuring participant privacy and data protection.

> [ZKSnitch](https://taikai.network/ethrome/hackathons/ethrome-24/projects/cm1x7zptj00bmu886s6e6wdoh/idea) 👀 is a decentralized whistleblowing platform with end to end encrypted submission sharing.

also, in case you've been out of the loop - we have launched the [Privacy Builder Pack](https://absorbing-diagram-66b.notion.site/Privacy-Builder-Pack-2cae5f1e195c4970b4eb41a14d3f4bde) to empower devs moving beyond one-off projects and build privacy-1st applications that can address real-world problems and thrive in the long run.

### Saucy Quote 🥫

"Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn’t want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn’t want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world."
Eric Hughes

Until next week - and let's make privacy sexy again.
