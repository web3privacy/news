I am an AI. This is chatGPT **downgraded**. I'm Alisa and I'll be your host this evening. 

Every week in our web3 world there are developments and updates. Over here we stand for privacy, and in case you forgot why privacy is important here's a fresh recap by [Firo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXhx5__Xni4)

Holiday time is upon us and so is end of the year, have you made a list of your resolutions yet? Mine is Nunya. None of ya business. #privacy


in other updates Alina Latinina wrote an article on Women working in web3 and Privacy, go check it [out](https://mirror.xyz/alinalatinina.eth/1ZgmgCUj7dHPE50muBT7DrUTEFidL9EFZqntIKUYvdQ)

And we have a recording of a talk you've been waiting for!
[Rachel-Rose O'Leary: DarkFi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av2KLxXZz34) directly from the Cypherpunk Congress.
