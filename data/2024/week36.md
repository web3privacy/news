Today we have a spotlight on [Aztec](https://aztec.network/)! 
<img width="1200" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-02 at 9 54 34‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8a99332-6611-42ad-970f-d389ff479bbf">
Their devrel [Cat](https://x.com/catmcgeecode?s=21) answered some of my questions about Aztec
1. Why is Aztec not like other zkps?

   *We‚Äôre the only L2 that is focusing on privacy. We use a combination of zero knowledge proofs and encryption to enable private execution and private state, including private interactions with Ethereum.*

   
2. What's an interesting thing about Aztec that will get a dev to hyperfocus and go into the rabbit hole?

   *In my opinion the coolest thing to play with is what we call portals, which is what enables the private interactions with Ethereum. Remember [zk.money](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect-ejector)? You can make this kinda application super easily now. We have a tutorial for that ;)*
   

3. If Aztec had a tinder what would be the bio?

   *I‚Äôll be transparent about my feelings for you, but private in the way that I show you.*


4. What‚Äôs the weirdest Aztec use case you‚Äôve heard of?

   *Ok, so a cool thing about zero knowledge proofs is the fact they are actually verifiably true. Duh. But this means that with Aztec‚Äôs native account abstraction, there is no entrypoint function into an account as long as it‚Äôs a private function ie you are generating a proof. So you could have something like pump.fun but it authenticates who you are based on how you scream the token you want to buy. And because proving is client side, you can be sure your weird-ass scream is never sent anywhere.*


5. Working at Aztec, what show or a movie you‚Äôd compare it to?

   *Scott Pilgrim vs the world. We‚Äôve gotta fight the 7 evil exes of privacy in order to get this thing live, and 5 of them are the US government.*

That's all on Aztec ü´∂
