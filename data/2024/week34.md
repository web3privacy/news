gm

today was a big one. 

we hosted [Cyperpunk Congress](https://lu.ma/w3pn-meetup-devcon7) in Bangkok (as a pregame to devcon), and as im writing this we are wrapping up our last panel of the day. 

you guys, this has been insane. 

the speakers, the guests, the food, the vibes. 

immaculate. 

as promised, heres a silly collection of unserious overheard quotes. all our of context and anon. 

for serious stuff go on X! 

lets dive into it! 

"20$ is 20$"

"You gotta have a sustainable strategy about drinking"

"One sec I was mesmerized by a character"

on stage: "ah shit... yea i looove the thai government"

*sees broken screen design at the venue: that was made by a designer, not a coder" 

at events "It’s for the team" is equivalent of "it’s for the bride" 

"It’s a feature not a bug !!!!"

"Jesus can walk on water, I can open a beer with water"

"im vegetarian" "this is fish" "ah i consider fish a plant" 

"hey its my first panel im moderating, - any tips?"
me: find what they disagree on and give the audience a show!
