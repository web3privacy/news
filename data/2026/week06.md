Good Monday, friends of privacy!

This week we track the escalating battle for digital privacy, from VPN raids and Signal account attacks to Apple’s Lockdown Mode blocking law enforcement access. Great way how to maintain one's privacy is the default using of VPNs and this is great opportunity to use the Beta of Tor VPN, our Tool of the week.
