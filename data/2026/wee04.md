Good Monday, friends of privacy!

This week we take a closer look at LLM by Ollama and their new Ollama Launch in the Tool of the week category. Besides that, it's good to take a look at recent news about Microsoft giving out acces keys to encrypted Windows disks to FBI or UK's government attempts to ban VPN.

There is no other season as a privacy season and the second bet time to start caring about it is now! So let's jump in and take a look at freshest news and tool tips with this week's newsletter.
