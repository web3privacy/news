Good Monday, friends of privacy!

Another week has passed by and all our timelines has been buzzing about lobsters - not for eating, but rather for chatting. As the topic is fresh and there is still lot to unpack and research, we think it is good to meanwhile check out another AI agent. So as the tool of the week, welcome Gru and their fresh new v2!
