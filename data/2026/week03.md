Good Monday, friends of privacy!

While last two weeks were so far full of rather negative news, with escalation of conflicts in Iran and Syria, Internet outage in Uganda and Venezuela or ICE's raid, all while showcasing the potential power of governments, it is good to remind ourselves how we can empower ourselves by using privacy heavy and decentralized tools.

Thanks to the Internet outage, Bitchat was the most downloaded app in Uganda and so we bring the Bitchat as a Tool of the week.
