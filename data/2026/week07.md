Good Monday, friends of privacy!

While some of us are still thinking about Monerotopia, let's take a look together on what has happened in the last week. There is new phone from Solana, privacy options now coming even from BigTech and the general public seems to care more and more about privacy each day. After Discord's implementation of Age Verification, mass migration happened leading folks to Matrix.org, thus naming it this week's Tool of the week.
