Good day, 

Today we announced a [MEMATHON](https://lu.ma/6dtpioqm)! Launching on 1st of April - by the way, this is not a joke. Would we put so much effort into a joke? Well, probably yes. But it's not. So sign up, subit on JokeRace, and feel free to let your imagination go wild on the open track or the bounties.
