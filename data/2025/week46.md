Good Monday, friends of privacy!

Past and upcoming week has both been booming with amazing stuff going on for those interested in privacy. While we here at Web3PrivacyNow are pretty busy with last preps for our Buenos Aires Congress, some big things happened. 

Be it drop of new Debuan, ZCash value skyrocketing or Mullvad shifting their browser policy, we believe you can find whatever sparks your interest in this week's newsletter. So enjoy and we hope to see you in Argentina!
