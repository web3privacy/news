Good evening and welcome to the cosy corner of crypto that is not going to mention any of the recent developments (you can head over to crypto twitter for the memes and the rants).

Hope your 2025 is off to a good start. Here over at web3privacy now we have been cooking and prepping, with big things coming up on the horizon! Yes, you've heard that one before from like every protocol ever, but we are NOT a protocol - we are a collective of people trying to make the world of web3 privacy stronger and a bit more digestable to the public. (But first, we need to understand our own intricate Miro boards and ddocs (shoutout to Fileverse)

Here are some of our recent (public) developments:

- [Unlocking Privacy for All: W3PN Academy Launch](https://mirror.xyz/0x0f1F3DAf416B74DB3DE55Eb4D7513a80F4841073/76TEt51zJUfjvcG6Gw2-XN0IbESlXYHGO2GOr4CKnpc)
- [Privacy proof awards'24: news & events category longlist](https://mirror.xyz/0x0f1F3DAf416B74DB3DE55Eb4D7513a80F4841073/IN-RxNtVsMvjUe_XNwDJhxNxIR2efw2auXCLohqSgxI)
- [Our own Hackathon in Berlin](https://lu.ma/wero3jvo=)
- and if you're feeling generous we set up our donation fund over [here](https://giveth.io/project/web3privacy-now-advocating-for-digital-privacy)

Now let's dive into the latest updates in privacy!
