I like to believe that cats are Web3privacy Now mascots. 

Hear me out: 

<img width="1003" alt="Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 6 37 53â€¯PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/405945c2-06cc-48c5-89e0-0a7e0c1b2801" />

- cats have been at the epicenter of Internet since forever, and secretly became a mascot of digital activism 
- cats are pro privacy
- they are independent, just like our team culture
- cats are selective on who they trust (rings a bell?)
- cats are nocturnal, just like most of us adhd chaotic neutrals
- chatgpt confirmed: "cats make people feel safe while embracing their quirks", and that's our cosy side of web3 privacy in one sentence.

so it's decided, (reminder: ping team).

Also, from someone that scrolls through X non stop to find some news for you, here are some general unofficial trends this week:
- lots on ai + privacy, it feels like lots of major protocols are pivoting into that
- so many partnerships! exciting, but also could you cut down on the huge graphics and just make some points on what it is going to bring?
- personal posts from privacy peeps are most apreciated
- not enough memes, who's working on this? (hint - us) 

Another note from chronic online me, - with the recent events in the US, Tiktok has been blowing up, here are some notes on how genz is fighting back:
- [cute winter boots](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/cute-winter-boots-a-resistance-movement-disguised-as-a-tiktok-trend-explained/articleshow/117558524.cms?from=mdr) (keep this to yourself)
- anti facial recognition make up is trending
- [80s punk lace code](https://www.tumblr.com/safety-pin-punk/684998289903484928/punk-101-lace-code) is making a comeback, this time with doc martens

> what comes first web3 or privacy? 
once either will get picked up by genz crew on tiktok, it'll have a bigger effect than recent yassification of crypto in the U.S. I can feel it in my gut.

now, for the updates!
