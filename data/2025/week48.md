Good Monday, friends of privacy!

From Amir Taaki's deportation from Argentina to launching their messaging app, folks at DarkFi are pretty busy. So let's start this week with taking a look at their app. We also want to thank everyone who stopped by at our event or at our presentations at DevConnect. 

Privacy is beautiful!
