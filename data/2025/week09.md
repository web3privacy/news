While working full time in crypto / privacy and seeing the most ludicrous news ever popping up on your screen, it is important to remember the image of a happy decentralized internet.

Utopia? Maybe, but without taking steps in the right directon, we will absolutely lose the plot.

On the bright side, things are heating up - with Apple pulling end-to-end encryption from the UK, more people are starting to talk about importance of privacy.
With that, more people are starting to *learn* about the importance of privacy. 
And slowly, and then all at once, we will embrace a new era where privacy is no longer a luxury or an afterthought. It's a demand.
